Token Allocation Algorithm
The system uses priority-based dynamic allocation.

1.Priority Order
Emergency = 4
Paid Priority = 3
Follow-up = 2
Normal = 1

2.Booking logic
a. Check if slot has free capacity
b. If space exists → assign token
c. If slot is full:
   Find lowest priority patient in slot
   Compare with new request
   If new priority is higher → replace
   Else → add to waiting list

3.Emergency logic
a. Emergency patients are always assigned
b. If slot is full:
   Remove lowest priority patient
   Insert emergency patient
   Shift removed patient to waiting list

4.Cancellation logic
a. Remove cancelled token from slot 
b. If waiting list is not empty:
   Automatically assign first waiting patient
c. Slot capacity is maintained
