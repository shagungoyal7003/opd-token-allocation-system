1.Prioritization Logic
a. Patients are served based on urgency:
   Emergency patients get maximum priority.
   Follow-up and paid priority patients are served before normal walk-in patients.

This ensures critical patients are never delayed.

2.Edge Cases Handled
a. Slot Full
   System blocks new normal bookings
   Adds patient to waiting list
b. Emergency Insertion  
   Emergency patients override low priority bookings
   Slot capacity is preserved
c. Cancellation Handling
   Cancelled token automatically triggers reallocation
   Waiting patient is moved into slot
d. No-Show Handling
   No-show is treated same as cancellation
   Slot is freed and reassigned automatically

3.Failure Handling
  Invalid token cancellation returns safe error message
  Slot overflow is prevented
  Server handles invalid requests gracefully
